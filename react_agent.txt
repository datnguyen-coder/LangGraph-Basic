#! Annotated - provides additional context/information without affecting the type itself
                   [data type, metadata]
# email = Annotated[str, "This has to be a valid email format!"]

# print(email.__metadata__)

#! Sequence - to automatically handle the state updates for sequences such as by adding new messages to a chat history

#! Reducer Function 
# Rule that controls how updates from nodes are combined with the existing state
# Tells us how to merge new data into the current state

# without a reducer, updates would have replaced the existing value entirely

#~ Without a reducer
# state = {"messages": ["Hi!"]}
# update = {"messages": ["Nice to meet you!"]}
# new_state = {"messages": ["Nice to meet you!"]}

#~ With a reducer
# state = {"messages": ["Hi!"]}
# update = {"messages": ["Nice to meet you!"]}
# new_state = {"messages": ["Hi!", "Nice to meet you!"]}
